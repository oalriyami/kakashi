/**
 * PolicyGuard -- the deterministic authority.
 *
 * This component sits BETWEEN the planner and the executor and has more
 * authority than either. A plan it rejects is never executed, and there is no
 * code path by which a planner (deterministic today, semantic from M4) can
 * override it. That asymmetry is the whole point: reasoning proposes, policy
 * disposes.
 *
 * Kakashi had no configuration or policy layer at all before this
 * (docs/AGENTIC_ARCHITECTURE.md SS11), so this is new -- but it is new *data*
 * plus a pure validation function. No I/O, no network, no dynamic loading.
 *
 * Policy vocabulary, per (policy, destination):
 *
 *   denyOutright[]      Cannot be released to this destination in ANY form, not
 *                       even tokenised. Produces an immediate BLOCK.
 *   prohibited[]        Must not be DETECTABLE in the released artifact. The
 *                       hard constraint the verifier checks.
 *   restricted[]        Should be transformed when the goal asks to minimise
 *                       disclosure, but its presence does not block release.
 *   requiresApproval[]  A human must sign off before release, even transformed.
 *   allowedTransforms   Caps which tools the planner may choose for a class.
 *                       Absent class => every transform tool is permitted.
 *   minNameConfidence   Lowest confidence at which a name finding counts:
 *                       'low' (default -- Title Case alone is enough),
 *                       'medium' (the name list or a field must agree) or
 *                       'high' (a field or cue only). Observe, execute and
 *                       verify all use it, so a name below the threshold is
 *                       neither transformed nor held against the artifact.
