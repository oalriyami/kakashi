/**
 * Verifier -- the component that makes the loop a loop.
 *
 * `kakashi mask` has never checked its own work: it writes an output and exits.
 * The Guardian re-reads the artifact FROM DISK -- through the same
 * formats.readFile the rest of Kakashi uses, so a lossy or buggy format writer is
 * caught too -- and runs the full 35-pattern detector over it again. Not the
 * in-memory string the executor produced: the bytes that actually landed.
 *
 * The criterion is DETECTABILITY, not intent. If a prohibited class is still
 * detectable in the artifact, the goal is unsatisfied, regardless of why. This is
 * deliberately strict and it has a real consequence worth stating plainly:
 *
 *   `maskText` mode `fake` substitutes values from `pattern.fakeValues`, which
 *   are format-preserving and therefore still match their own pattern.
 *   `national_id`'s fake is `784-1990-9999999-0`; `intl_phone`'s are real-shaped
 *   UAE numbers. A synthetic Emirates ID will FAIL verification.
 *
 * That is correct, not a bug. A downstream DLP scanner cannot tell a synthetic
 * Emirates ID from a live one either, and a synthetic UAE mobile number may well
 * belong to somebody. Format preservation is acceptable for a class the policy
 * merely restricts; it is not acceptable for one the policy prohibits. The
 * planner learns this from the verifier at runtime and escalates.
