/**
 * Path validation for the Guardian.
 *
 * The Guardian reads a resource the caller names and writes an artifact beside
 * it. Both halves are attacker-reachable in a realistic deployment (an AI agent
 * under prompt injection is exactly the caller we are defending against), so
 * both are validated here rather than at each call site.
 *
 * Rules:
 *   - No NUL bytes (defeats truncation tricks against the C layer).
 *   - The input must resolve, via realpath, to a REGULAR file. Symlinks are
 *     followed once and then judged on their target, so a symlink to /dev/zero
 *     or to a FIFO is refused rather than read.
 *   - The output's PARENT directory must exist and realpath to a directory; the
 *     output must resolve inside it (no `../` escape through a symlinked parent).
 *   - The output may never be the input. The Guardian does not overwrite
 *     originals, full stop -- unlike `kakashi mask --overwrite`, there is no flag.
