/**
 * Shared OOXML run handling for .docx and .pptx.
 *
 * Both formats store a paragraph's text as a SEQUENCE OF RUNS -- `<w:t>` inside
 * `<w:p>` for Word, `<a:t>` inside `<a:p>` for PowerPoint -- and both split those
 * runs for reasons that have nothing to do with where a value starts or ends:
 * a spellcheck mark, a language attribute, a revision id, one bolded character.
 * A single email address routinely lands in the file as two or three runs.
 *
 * That makes the naive approach wrong in two ways at once, and this module
 * exists to fix both:
 *
 *   1. READING. Joining runs with a space (what this code used to do) inserts
 *      a separator that was never in the document. `sk-ant-` + `api03-...`
 *      became `sk-ant- api03-...`, which matches no credential pattern at all,
 *      so the scanner reported the file clean while a live key sat in it. Runs
 *      within one paragraph are now joined with NOTHING, which is what the
 *      format actually means -- real spaces are their own characters inside
 *      `<w:t xml:space="preserve"> </w:t>`. Paragraphs are still joined with a
 *      newline so unrelated blocks cannot fuse into a false positive.
 *
 *   2. WRITING. Literal substring replacement over the raw XML can only ever
 *      patch a value that sits inside ONE run, because a value spanning a run
 *      boundary has XML tags in the middle of it and never appears contiguously.
 *      Replacement here is OFFSET-BASED over the reassembled paragraph text, and
 *      the result is redistributed across the runs it covered: the run where the
 *      match begins receives the whole token, and the runs holding the rest of
 *      the match give up their share. Untouched runs keep their bytes exactly,
 *      so formatting elsewhere in the paragraph survives.
 *
 * Entities are decoded on read and re-encoded on write, so a value containing
 * `&` is matched as `&` rather than as `&amp;`.
